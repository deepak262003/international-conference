ABSTRACT:
The pineapple is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most
economically significant plant in the family Bromeliace. The pineapple fruit and peel
have a high amount of Vitamin C, the nutrient that helps in boosting immunity. The
other extremely beneficial enzyme found in Pineapple peel is Bromelain that is
known to cut down inflammation in the body. Mix peel extract material with the
ethanol. Use enough ethanol so the material is completely submerged. Leave the
mixture in an ultralow temperature freezer for a day. The ethanol will separate the
soluble components of the extract during this soaking . Remove all solid materials
with a filtration step requiring only a BÃ¼chner funnel, and a vacuum flask. After the
material has been filtered, a solution of ethanol and extract remains. Now the extract
needs to be separated from the ethanol. To separate the two, use a rotary evaporator.
When connected to a vacuum pump, the rotary evaporator uses the vacuum to lower
the boiling point of ethanol, resulting in a quicker evaporation. The resulting extract
or oil will be completely free of ethanol. This process also allows ethanol to be
recovered for additional extractions. A variety of rotary evaporator sizes are
available to fit any application, ranging from laboratory research use to large-scale
production plants. If needs change, ramping up production will not be an issue. If
the rotary evaporator is not equipped with a heating bath, one will need to be
purchased separately. A is also needed as this connects to the rotary evaporator to
accelerate solvent recovery. After completing these simple steps, the extract is now
ready for the next phase of the process.
