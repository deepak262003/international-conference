ABSTRACT:
Papaya seeds accounts for 22% of waste content from papaya puree
industry.They are subjected to study for their benefits.It is found that crude
protein and crude fibre content were high .Papaya seeds act as good source of
proteins(27.3%-28.3%),antioxidant lipids (28%-30%) and crude fibres(19%-
22%).The seed is low in monosaccharides.They can help to reduce blood
pressure and cholesterol levels.The consumption level of the seeds is advisable
as 1 teaspoon.More than this level of consumption is known toxic.Trace
amount of cyanide present in the seeds makes it toxic.This study aims at
extraction of proteins from ripe papaya seeds by enzymatic method.Two
commercial proteases Alcalase and Flavourzyme are used in this method to
extract protein.The enzymatic method is carried out in 40 degree celcius,initial
ph of 7 at an enzyme concentration of 1%& time from 1 upto 24 hours.The
crude protein is further purified by using three phase partitioning method.The
three phase partitioning method uses t-butanol and ammonium sulphate to
precipitate proteins from aqueous solution.The amount of protein obtained is
measured by using Brafordâ€™s method.
