ABSTRACT
Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, tangerines, and mandarins, are
among the world's most frequently farmed fruits. Because of expanding customer
demand, its production grows every year. Every year, the citrus processing industry
produces massive volumes of trash, with citrus peel waste accounting for over half of
the wet fruit mass. Citrus trash is extremely valuable economically since it contains a lot
of flavonoids, carotenoids, dietary fibre, sugars, polyphenols, essential oils, and ascorbic
acid, as well as a lot of trace elements. Citrus waste also includes a lot of sugars that can
be fermented to produce bioethanol. However, for optimal bioethanol production,
chemicals like D-limonene must be eliminated. The purpose of this paper was to discuss
the most recent developments in several common extraction methods for getting
valueadded products from citrus waste/byproducts, as well as their potential utility as a
source of diverse functional compounds.
