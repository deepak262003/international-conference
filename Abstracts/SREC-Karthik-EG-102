Abstract : One of the most important concerns facing the globe now is the energy crisis. The only
remedy for this problem is renewable energy. In recent years, solar panels have been employed
more frequently to transform solar energy into electrical energy. It is reasonably priced and almost
completely safe for the environment. The electromagnetic radiation that is used to produce
electricity is released by it. The major goal is to develop a workable autonomous solar tracking
system that moves the solar panel so that it remains always perpendicular to the sun. In this system,
the sensor will be a photo resistor. The vertical and horizontal axes of the dual axis solar panel are
rotated in order to increase the efficiency of the device. Hence dual axis provides precise control of
elevation of the panel relative to the sun. This will provide better efficiency of the panel.
