ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY

ABSTRACT:

The application of AI in agriculture has been widely considered as one of the
most viable solutions to address food inadequacy and to adapt to the need of growing
population Soil and weed control are two areas where AI may be crucial, and the Internet of
Things (IoT), a technology with enormous potential for the future, is also discussed. Uneven
mechanised distribution, algorithms' capacity to swiftly and accurately handle huge amounts
of data, and data security and privacy are the three issues that must be resolved for AI-based
technology to become widely accepted in the market. Although pointing out the difficulty of
adapting machines and algorithms demonstrated in experimental conditions to actual
situations, the study emphasises an already profitable progress and a future that promises
even greater advancements in the field of agricultural robotics. Due to rising food demand in
tandem with the growing global population over the past few decades, artificial intelligence
(AI) has become the latest technology in the food industry. The capacity of the
aforementioned intelligent systems to perform a variety of activities, including determining
food quality, providing control mechanisms, categorising foods, and making predictions has
increased demand for them in the food sector. In order to help choose the best strategies for
advancing future developments related to AI and the food industry, this paper reviews a
variety of applications and compares their benefits, drawbacks, and formulations.
Additionally, this system may be integrated with additional gadgets like an electronic tongue,
nose, and computer vision system.
