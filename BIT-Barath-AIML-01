Abstract: Employee attrition is the burdensome issue which are faced by an
organization or employers. There are many reasons for employee attrition which should
be avoided by any means. Industries with high attrition experience knowledge loss,
training costs, and a never-ending recruiting cycle. For every firm, finding and keeping
qualified employees is a major challenge. Time is needed to create a formal employee
satisfaction survey, establish a career promotion programmer, and develop a methodical
hiring procedure. Only those who are unfit of employment will remain if employees
complain about onerous workloads, extra hours, or inadequate pay. The research under
consideration demonstrates a strong correlation between overtime and monthly revenue
with attrition. The main aim of employee attrition analytics is to predict which staff
members will leave next and to create a system which may assist in staff retention. This
work presents the Multilayer Perceptron (MP) model is for analyzing employee
attrition. This work utilizes IBM Watson Human Resource datasets for experimentation.
The experimental result shows MP gives 81.87% accuracy for 2-, 3- and 4-layer
networks. The job level, total working of years and monthly income play vital roles in
employee attrition.
